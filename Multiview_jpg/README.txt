The seeds were placed (center) inside a mini photo box 'Onsmo Mini Product Photo Box P50 Portable LED Photography Studio Light Tent'. 
Images were captured by using a iPhone 12 camera, which was mounted on mini tripods set up 20 cm away from the seeds, its height was set 30 cm above with its holder slanted 45 degree. 
I set up only 4 mini tripods for 4 views which are (in sequence) front, left, right, and rear. 
For the top view (captured last in sequence) I placed the camera 45 cm above the seeds.
